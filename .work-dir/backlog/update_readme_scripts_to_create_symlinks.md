Currently in the sites directory, in the content directory, in the site directory, the topics are similar. I do not want to maintain them manually. So we need to think of a solution to fix this, and I think we have a way of doing this, and this is the Python script we currently have.

So I will first want you to analyze if this is the best solution and if not come with come up with other solutions or let me rephrase. Come up with three solutions to fix this problem, one of them being an update to the README script, and then propose me what is the best solution, implementation solution moving forward.

So the goal is to run the script on every build and deploy or run. So the topics the symbolings are created automatically if they do not exist for new topics.
