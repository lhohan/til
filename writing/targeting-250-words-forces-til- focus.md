# Targeting <250 words forces TIL focus

After a few weeks of writing TILs and finding it taking too long, I went back to the source and decided to focus on a 250-word limit.

This kind of limit forces **a single learning per entry**. 

I can't fit multiple ideas in without losing clarity. If I go over, I'll need to remove either background information or concepts. If I can't manage that, it's probably a blog post.
